Task: Generate all derived words from the true base form of any English word I provide.
Instructions:
1. 	Determine the true base form (lemma) of the input word. This applies to verbs, nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.
2. 	Generate all real English words derived from that base form, including:
• 	All verb forms (past, past participle, -ing, -s)
• 	All noun forms (singular, plural, derivations)
• 	All adjective and adverb forms
• 	Common compounds and derivatives
• 	Words formed with prefixes like mis-, dis-, un-, re-
• 	Words formed with suffixes like -able, -ment, -ness, -er, etc.
3. 	Map every derived word to the true base form.
4. 	Output the results as a JSON object block using this exact style:
  "derived_word_1": "base_word",
  "derived_word_2": "base_word",
  "derived_word_3": "base_word",
  ... 
Rules:
• 	Each line indented with two spaces
• 	Include a comma after the last line
• 	No blank lines between entries
• 	Only include words that actually exist in English
• 	Always map every derived word to the true base form
Example:
Input: aside → Base form: side
  "side": "side",
  "sides": "side",
  "sided": "side",
  "siding": "side",
  "sideways": "side",
  "sidelong": "side",
