🌟 Highlight Project – Language Learning Assistant
This tool is designed for ABS captions and webpages. You can use it almost anywhere — except when you’re using ABS Player.

💡 What It Does
This system highlights and underlines words while you study. It doesn’t include a built-in dictionary, so you can use your own, such as Yomitan.
Since the data is new, you’ll need to add base forms manually using pop-ups when you encounter new words. You can define words yourself or use an assistant like Copilot or a chatbot.
If you’re comfortable editing JSON files, you can add words directly there. Otherwise, entering them manually helps reinforce learning — it’s great practice to truly understand all word forms and verbs.

🧠 Why I Built This Tool
I wanted a simple, free, and lightweight tool for language learning — something that could highlight words across webpages, ABS, and YouTube.
After testing many options, I found most were either paid or too heavy for Chrome. So I decided to build my own tool, with help from ChatGPT and a lot of experimentation. Now, it’s open-source, free, and anyone can customize it.

⚙️ Getting Started

🗒️ Notes & Lemmas
- File 1: Used for making notes
- File 2: Used for writing lemmas (base forms)
Any color or note you add applies to all forms of that word in your dictionary (irregularwords.json). You’ll find it in your project’s data folder.

✍️ Example: Phrasal Verbs
If you define “look up” in your data, it will automatically link:
- look up
- looking up
- looked up
All counted as the same phrase.
This is especially useful for sentences and phrasal verbs, since their meanings often change by form.

🧩 Why Two Pop-ups?
Because meanings can vary between word forms and phrases. For example, “run” and “run into” have completely different meanings. One popup is for single words, the other for phrases or sentences.
